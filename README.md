# DigitalAudioRecorder-Arduino
A project based on the Arduino-Uno board, which is capable of recording audio at a decent sampling rate (i.e. sound recordings are of mediocre quality). The sound recordings were then analysed using Fast Fourier Transformation(FFT) for obtaining plots in the frequency domain.
